Should be "working"

## Log
- Created a new Java project using VSCode
- Renamed the automatically created App class to HangmanTester and created a new class called HangmanTester
- Downloaded the pieces of code provided and selected the options with efficient programming usage and better comments
- Copied and pasted the selected options into the new "Hangman" class.
- Refactored the code and comments (specifically focused on harmony throughout the code - code and comment styling)
- Go through the code in both classes and see if anything is missing.
- Fix and errors reported by the IDE.
